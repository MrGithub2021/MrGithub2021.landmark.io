        <p>The Reichstag Building is a historic erection in Berlin, Germany. Its main purpose was to store the Imperial Diet of the German Empire.<br> Today, it's a historic landmark to remember. The building has a beutiful dome!<br> On 1933, it was set on fire by some political party. No one knows who did this horrific crime.</p>

        <p>There is a balcony on the building that is awesome! You can get a good view of Berlin!<br> Another thing about the dome is that it exsquisite stained glass! </p>
